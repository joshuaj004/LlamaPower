    <h1>Llamas: The Quick Overview</h1>

    <p class="llamaP">
        Prior to this little project, my only exposures to llamas were driving past them once in Oregon and seeing The Emperor's New Groove. It's actually a really great movie and Kronk is who I aim to be, but it's probably not the most accurate. And I know that
        everyone who comes to this site is looking for only the most accurate of information concerning llamas.
    </p>
    <p class="llamaP">
        Llamas are actually fairly massive creatures, which can clock in at 440 pounds. And not like the British Currency. Funnily enough, they weigh things in stones. No idea why that's a thing, but I digress, back to llamas. Llamas are generally found in herds, probably
        because they're very vain and rely on other llamas' compliments to go about their daily lives. If you've seen the Emperor's New Groove, you know just how true that is.
    </p>
    <p class="llamaP">
        Llamas are kind of a big deal in Peru, a country that I've not been to, but would someday love to go. I will offer myself up as tribute to be the one that Zappos sends on <s>a vacation</s> a learning trip <i>(totally-not-a-vacation, 100% scholarly)</i>  to Peru to study the llama. You can make arrangements by contacting me from now until pretty much whenever. I hope you've learned a lot, because one of us should've.

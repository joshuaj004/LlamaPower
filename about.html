				<h1>Josh Johnson</h1>
				<p class="bio">
					Current student at the University of Washington, pretty knowledgeable on programming, but still
					not sure on the difference between Llamas and Alpacas even though I've looked at
					like 6 different websites...
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					I've lived in a bunch of places like South Africa, Costa Rica, and Luxembourg, so feel free to ask
						anything about those places. Big fan of HBO's Silicon Valley and Game of Thrones, as well as FX's
						It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. When I'm not working on something programming related
						I'm probably hiking, biking, or thinking about the former.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					The reason why I like front-end development is because as soon as I make something,
					with something they can access from their phones, tablets, and laptops compared
					it's immediately available to anyone with an internet connection. It's a lot easier
					to impress people	to the command line. Being able to quickly prototype something or
					mockup a simple website for any reason (like just 'cause) really makes front-end
					development a passion of mine.
				</p>
				<p class="bio">
					As for this website, it's currently using jQuery and Bootstrap on top of your standard
					HTML/CSS. I'm using jQuery over plain JS because while there is some overhead with
					jQuery, it makes selection way simpler and I'm not one to copy and paste
					<code>document.getElementById("UghDocumentGetElementByIdIsSoTediousHashtagExaggerations")</code> over
					and over. I'm using Bootstrap because I like the little glyphicons and I think it's useful
					for making this website look good cross-platform.
